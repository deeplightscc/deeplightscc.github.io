  Some materials for DeepLight <br>
  1. The images used to train DeepLight Screen Extractor [<a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/tree/master/screen-detection-indoor">Indoor scenes</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/tree/master/screen-detection-outdoor">Outdoor scenes</a>]<br>
  2. The representative <a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/tree/master/user_study_videos">images</a> of videos used in the user study <br>
  3. The representative <a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/tree/master/lightnet-train">images</a> of videos used to train DeepLight Decoder <br>
  4. The representative <a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/tree/master/experiment_videos">images of videos</a> used in the experiment <br>
  5. A video showing DeepLight operation in real-time (<a href="https://github.com/deeplightscc/deeplightscc.github.io/blob/master/demo.MP4">demo.MP4</a>).<br> 
  Please open the video, notice the time the user press record button (Round Red), it changes to Rectangle Red (while recording video), and then to Round Green when it finishes recording and it starts transmitting the video to a server. Near the end of the video, you will see a short text of "Alice in Wonder Land" updated on the screen.<br>
  The DeepLight application takes 1 second of video at 120FPS and sends it to a server to decode using DeepLight full system (including DeepLight Screen Extractor and DeepLight Decoder). 
  The server will send the text result (Alice in Wonder Land) back to the iPhone after processing it.<br>
  Currently, the long delay is caused by the transmission time. As we use MJPG video at the highest quality, the video size is still large (though we use 1280x720 resolution to reduce the size).
  Recently, iPhone can run MobileNet in real-time, so we believe that it can easily run DeepLight in real-time <br>
